        "description": "Are you someone who feels the need to hug every tree you come across? Are you a fan of getting to know green spaces? Exploring whether an environmental path is right for you at the UW? This event is a walkthrough of the Brockman Memorial Tree Tour. Newly renovated, this tour was designed to show off a subset of the more than 480 tree species which grow on the UW campus. This walking activity will depart from the large wooden bus shelter just West of Anderson Hall on the south side of NE Stevens Way and incorporate 70 species of magnificent trees . From the starting point we will depart on a roughly 2.5 mile easy paced walk around campus led by some of the designers of the updated tree tour, who will be sharing fun facts about the trees and providing guidance on how to use the tour resources. Participants are welcome to do as much or as little of the tour as they wish. The tour will initiate and conclude at the same location. Individuals wishing to view more information about the tour may visit https:\/\/sefs.uw.edu\/about\/tree-tour\/ and click \"Take the Tour\".",

Exploring whether an environmental path is right for you at the UW? This event is a walkthrough of the Brockman Memorial Tree Tour. Newly renovated, this tour was designed to show off a subset of the more than 480 tree species which grow on the UW campus. This walking activity will depart from the large wooden bus shelter just West of Anderson Hall on the south side of NE Stevens Way and incorporate 70 species of magnificent trees . From the starting point we will depart on a roughly 2.5 mile easy paced walk around campus led by some of the designers of the updated tree tour, who will be sharing fun facts about the trees and providing guidance on how to use the tour resources. Participants are welcome to do as much or as little of the tour as they wish. The tour will initiate and conclude at the same location. Individuals wishing to view more information about the tour may visit https:\/\/sefs.uw.edu\/about\/tree-tour\/ and click \"Take the Tour\".",

We\u2019ll marvel at the beauty of French Renaissance Revival (Denny Hall), then we\u2019ll compare the medieval charm of Collegiate Gothic (Suzzallo and Savery) with French cathedrals and Oxford University.  Our group will explore the richness of Beaux-Arts Neo-Classicism (Architecture Hall) and the brutal concrete of Brutalism (Kane Hall). To cap off this exciting tour we\u2019ll examine the Suzzallo fa\u00e7ade sculptures and the Quad gargoyles. The tour will meet outside the north entrance to Mary Gates Hall, directly south of Suzzallo, and will leave promptly at 10:10 am!  Please arrive before this time to make sure that you can find us and join the tour.\r\n\r\nYour guide: Mark Ondrake, MA, is a UW student and independent art historian. He\u2019s lived and studied in France, Switzerland, and England, and has a life-long passion for architectural history.   \r\n",
